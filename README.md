Note:
I have changed and adapted Dom.ino so that there should no longer be any problems with wigle.net. I have also made general errors or corrections, but as I have not yet built my own copy, I cannot test it for functionality.

## **Build Notes**  

### **Hardware Setup**  
- **Power**:  
  - Input: 5V (via USB-C or external power source).  
  - Optional: 18650 battery pack with 5V output.  

- **Bodge Cables**:  
  - Required for VIN connections due to PCB design.  

### **Software Setup**  
- **Main Controller**: Flash `Dom.ino` on the ESP32-S3 Feather TFT.  
- **Sub Nodes**: Flash `Sub.ino` on each XIAO module.  
  - **Important**: Manually set a unique `BOARD_ID` for each sub node to scan different channels.

## **Getting Started**  

1. **Hardware Assembly**:  
   - Solder components and bodge cables as noted.  
   - Ensure proper power connections (5V).  

2. **Software Flashing**:  
   - Flash `Dom.ino` to the main ESP32-S3 Feather TFT.  
   - Flash `Sub.ino` to each XIAO module, assigning unique `BOARD_ID` values.  

3. **First Boot**:  
   - Connect power and test functionality.  
   - Verify GPS and Wi-Fi scanning.

## **Powering the Device**  

- **Recommended**: 5V input via USB-C or external power source.  
- **Optional**: 18650 battery pack with 5V output for portability.  

---

## **Troubleshooting**  

- **GPS Not Locking**: Ensure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky and is properly connected.  
- **Wi-Fi Channels Not Scanning**: Verify that all sub nodes have unique `BOARD_ID` values and are properly flashed.  
- **SD Card Errors**: Ensure the SD card is properly formatted and securely connected.
