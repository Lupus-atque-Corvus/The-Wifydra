# **The Wifydra**  
üì° Multi-headed 802.11 Panopticon  

The Wifydra is a wardriving tool for simultaneously monitoring all 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels, capturing network beacons, and geotagging locations. Data is stored on an SD card for easy upload to Wigle.net.

## **To-Do**  
- Display Customisations  
- Further Code Improvements  
- Improve PCB  

---

## **Project Notes**  
- I have changed and adapted `Dom.ino` to resolve issues with wigle.net and made general corrections. However, I haven't built my own copy yet to test functionality.  
- `Sub.ino` works as-is and doesn't require reworking.  
- The README is designed to be traceable and easy to follow for rebuilding.  
- PCB improvements are planned to fix lead connection issues.

## **Build Notes**  

### **Hardware Issues and Solutions**  
1. **PCB Power Issues**:  
   - Two bodge cables are required due to PCB design.  
   - One bodge cable connects the +3V output from the ESP32-S3 to the VIN of the SD Card or GPS.  
   - This fixes the mismatch between the +5V net on the ESP32-S3 and peripherals vs. the +3V net on sub nodes.  

2. **XIAO Module Footprint**:  
   - The PCB has a larger footprint for Seeedstudio XIAO modules than necessary.  
   - Adjust the modules slightly and ensure proper pin connections.

## **Hardware Setup**  

### **Power Requirements**  
- **Recommended**: 5V input via USB-C or external power source.  
- **Optional**: 18650 battery pack with 5V output for portability.  
- **Note**: Powering via the USB-C port of the ESP32-S3 Feather TFT is possible but not recommended due to unknown power draw implications.

### **Firmware Flashing**  
- **Main Controller**: Flash `Dom.ino` on the ESP32-S3 Feather TFT.  
- **Sub Nodes**: Flash `Sub.ino` on each XIAO module.  
  - **Important**: Manually set a unique `BOARD_ID` for each sub node to ensure proper channel scanning (1-14).  

---

## **Getting Started**  

1. **Hardware Assembly**:  
   - Solder components and bodge cables as noted.  
   - Ensure proper power connections (5V).  

2. **Software Flashing**:  
   - Flash `Dom.ino` to the main ESP32-S3 Feather TFT.  
   - Flash `Sub.ino` to each XIAO module, assigning unique `BOARD_ID` values.  

3. **First Boot**:  
   - Connect power and test functionality.  
   - Verify GPS and Wi-Fi scanning.  

---

## **Troubleshooting**  

- **GPS Not Locking**: Ensure the GPS module has a clear view of the sky and is properly connected.  
- **Wi-Fi Channels Not Scanning**: Verify that all sub nodes have unique `BOARD_ID` values and are properly flashed.  
- **SD Card Errors**: Ensure the SD card is properly formatted and securely connected.
